        "\n",
        "In this assignment, we're required to build a machine learning algorithm that can be used in a movie recommendation system. In order to achieve that, we're going to work use k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. \n",
        "\n",
        "The program will be given 4 csv files. movies.csv which have movieId, movie \n",
        "\n",
        "*   movies.csv which has columns for movie's ID, movie's title, and genre.\n",
        "*   tags.csv which has columns user's ID, movie's ID, tag which the user used for movie and timestamp\n",
        "*   links.csv which has columns movie's ID on our system, movie's ID on Internet Movie Database and, movie's ID on The Movie Database\n",
        "*   ratings_train.csv which has columns user's ID, movie's ID, rating the user given to the movie and timestamp \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm I created will make a prediction on what would be rating a user gives to a particular movie which he/she haven't watched yet. Algorithm will use other users' rating on that movie who have similiar movie tastes.\n",
        "\n",
        "###**My Solution**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   I read given csv files and split the file that has ratings into 2 parts after shuffeling it. Tha part which has %80 of the file will be used for training and the other part will be used for testing.\n",
        "2.   Since a dataframe which makes accesing different users ratings for different movies easier would be useful, I create that dataframe using movies.csv and user ratings from training part of ratings_train.csv. While doing so, I create a dictionary that stores information of which users watched watched that movie for every single movie. That dictonaries usage will be explained later.\n",
        "3.   The program will predict ratings based on k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. I will select nearest neighbor to a user using cosine similarity. Highest similarity means nearest neighbor. Since every box in dataframe for ratings should be filled with values to calculate cosine similarities, empty boxes are filled with 0's. This solution has a very low cost and doesn't have a large negative effect on results. \n",
        "4.   I calculate and store similarities between every user on dataframe named userUserMatrix. After that, I declare k and start predicting ratings using k-NN.\n",
        "5.   The program does predictions for test data row by row. For every row, first it gets the userId and movieId. Feeding getWatchedNeighbours algorithm with userId and movieId, a list that has closest k neighbors to the user who watched that particular movie. Dictionary mentioned above is used to speed up this process.\n",
        "6.   After getting closest neighbors, prediction process startes. There is two option k-NN and weighted k-NN. Using formulas below, ratings are predicted. Absolute value of difference between the prediction and the real rating is calculated. This value is error on that prediction. This operation is done for every row in test data and average error is calculated. That is called mean absolute error(MAE).\n",

The reason behind that is when some closest neighbours didn't rate that particular movie, their ratings are taken as 0 to prevent errors and this lowers predictions too much. In order to prevent that, I took a different approach. I choose neighbors who watched that movie. For example when k=5, instead of choosing 5 closest neighbors to the user, first I get a list which stores usersId's of users who watched to movie and choose closest 5 between them.
